## Machine Learning Model
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting the trendiness of YouTube videos. By analyzing various factors such as video titles, descriptions, likes, dislikes, views, and comments, our model aims to forecast which videos are likely to trend on the platform. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation steps. Feel free to explore, contribute, or use the code for your own video prediction endeavors!
